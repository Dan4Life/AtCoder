# AtCoder

## A collection of my solution codes to "hard" AtCoder problems

### Now what do I mean by "hard"?

- Well, I consider any problem in the "div 1" difficulty range(ie 1 dan and above) to be hard.
- This is also equivalent to >=2000 Atcoder Rating.
- I also don't include problems with "experimental" rating.

### Why am I doing this?

- To get better at CP, duh...
- To easily keep track of my problem solutions...
- Plus, it may be useful for someone else that needs help in a hard problem.

### How far will you go with this?

- I firstly want to solve at least 200 Yellows, then all Oranges afterwards for now(as of 5th September, 2022)
- Hopefully I'm alive and have the motivation to continue solving them.
- Solving rougly solving 2 problems per day on average.

### As for harder problems ie. Reds,Bronzes,Silvers,Golds:

- This is too far in the future so I won't comment about this, but I do want to finish ALL.

### How about new hard problems that will appear in the future?

- Of course, I'll still be updating new hard problems I solve.

### Notes:

- I don't expect to solve ALL new problems, so it really isnt a complete archive.
- It should contain a huge percentage of the hard problems in a year, maybe? :)
