# AtCoder

## A collection of my solution codes to "hard" AtCoder problems

### Now what do I mean by "hard"?

- Well, I consider any problem in the "div 1" difficulty range(ie 1 dan and above) to be hard.
- I also don't include problems with "experimental" rating.

### Why am I doing this?

- To get better at CP, duh...
- To easily keep track of my problem solutions...
- Plus, it might be useful to others?
