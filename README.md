# AtCoder
**A collection of my solution codes to "hard" AtCoder problems**


**Now what do I mean by "hard"?**

Well, I consider any problem in the "div 1" difficulty range(ie 1 dan and above) to be hard.
This is also equivalent to >=2000 Atcoder Rating.
I also don't include problems with "experimental" rating.


**Why am I doing this?**

To get better at CP, duh...
To easily keep track of my problem solutions...
Plus, it may be useful for someone else that needs help in a hard problem.


**As of 5th September, 2022:**

**How far will you go with this?**

I firstly want to solve at least 200 Yellows, then all Oranges afterwards. This is all for now :)
Hopefully I'm alive and have the motivation to continue solving them.
Rougly solving 2 problems per day on average.


**Now, as for harder problems ie. Reds,Bronzes,Silvers,Golds:**

I also want to solve ALL of them, but that will be after August, 2023(Due to IOI).
This is too far in the future so I won't comment about this.
Can't be saying shit until i finish Oranges.


**How about new hard problems that will appear in the future?**

Of course, I'll still be updating new hard problems I solve.


**Notes:**

I don't expect to solve ALL new problems, so it really isnt a complete archive.

It should contain a huge percentage of the hard problems in a year, maybe? :)
